This is a file
That has content
And a pipe table - look!
|Col1|Col2|
|Data1|Data2|
|Wut - another row?|
Yeah, and because bytes are almost free: here comes another table! (It's also because we wanna test multiple tables in one file.)
|HeaderA|HeaderB|
|Row1A|Row1B|
|Row2A|Row2B|
Oh, and there's a footer as well, but you just read it...
